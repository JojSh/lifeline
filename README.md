## Lifeline
(name TBC)

### Where have you been all your life?

Looking back, we sometimes struggle to know where we've been. Maybe for a job application you need to know the date that you finished college or a previous role. Maybe you've seen a certain poignant old photo and you want to place it in the context of whatever else was going on in your life at the time. Perhaps an older relative wants to record their memories while they are still clear.

These are some of the things that I hope Lifeline (tbc) will be useful for. This is a visual map of your past and personal history. To serve as practical, or sentimental record. As minimal or as detailed as you like, to show where you've been and plot where you're going.
